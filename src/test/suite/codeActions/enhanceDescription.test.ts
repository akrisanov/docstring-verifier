	// Note: Command execution tests are skipped because:
	// 1. The command is already registered by the main extension with its own dependencies
	// 2. Testing would require refactoring to support dependency injection
	// 3. The command internally uses LLM service and editor registry from extension context
	// 
	// To properly test this command in the future:
	// - Refactor registerEnhanceDescriptionCommand to be testable
	// - Use dependency injection pattern
	// - Create mock LLM service and editor registry
	// - Test command handler logic separately from VS Code command registration
